**My goal is to become a web developer. I like working with computer technology. I'm easy to learn, polite in communication.**

`For example code only:`
```
// BEGIN
const encrypt = (str) => {
  let result = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i += 2) {
    const nextSymbol = str[i + 1] || '';
    result = `${result}${nextSymbol}${str[i]}`;
  }

  return result;
};
// END
```
I have no experience in web development. After receiving my diploma, I worked at *Rostelecom* with network equipment, then moved to *Rossetti South*, where I still work with automated electricity metering systems.

Graduated from the *Povolzhskaya State Academy of Telecommunications and Informatics* (Samara). Now I study in the *Rolling Scopes School*.

My English level is pre-intermediate.
